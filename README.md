# **SocialSphere: A Multi-Tier Web Application**

## **Project Overview**
**SocialSphere** is a highly scalable, automated, and multi-tier social networking web application. It is designed to provide seamless performance and optimized resource management. Built using **Java** and **Maven**, the project leverages **Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC)** principles for automated, repeatable deployments.

The application integrates a range of technologies, including **Nginx**, **Tomcat**, **RabbitMQ**, **Memcached**, **MySQL**, and **NFS**, to deliver a robust platform for dynamic user interactions and efficient data management.

## **How It Works**

**SocialSphere** employs a multi-tier architecture to ensure smooth scaling, allowing the application to handle a large number of users and interactions. Here's an overview of the core functionality:

1. **Frontend Layer**: 
   - **Nginx** serves as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and handles HTTP requests to route them efficiently between the frontend and backend services.
   
2. **Application Layer**: 
   - The backend of the application is hosted on **Tomcat**, where the Java-based application. Tomcat handles the business logic, user interactions, posts, notifications, and API responses.
   
3. **Data Layer**:
   - **MySQL** is used for storing persistent user and application data, ensuring quick retrieval and data integrity.
   - **Memcached** caches frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
   - **RabbitMQ** facilitates asynchronous messaging between different components, enhancing performance and scalability.
   - **NFS** provides scalable external storage, ensuring reliable handling of large volumes of data such as media files.

4. **Automation**:
   - The entire infrastructure is set up and managed through **Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC)** tools, ensuring a repeatable and automated deployment process across environments.

## **Features**
- **Scalable Architecture**: The multi-tier structure ensures that the application can easily scale as traffic grows.
- **Automated Deployment**: IaC principles ensure consistent, automated setup and deployment.
- **Efficient Caching & Messaging**: Optimized caching and message queuing mechanisms for improved performance.
- **Persistent Data Management**: NFS enables robust and scalable storage solutions.
- **Backend Built with Java**: The application backend is developed in Java, using **Maven** for efficient dependency management and build processes.
